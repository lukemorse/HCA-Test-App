# HCA Test App
This is a code evaluation as part of the interview process for HCA.

# Installation Instructions
I did not use any external dependencies, so just clone the repo, code sign the app with your certificate and you're good to go.

# Technologies
I used SwiftUI for the interface because I enjoy working with new frameworks and it is very good for prototyping apps quickly. This app uses URLSession to download data from the API and Decodable to decode the JSON.
